            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Had the Honour two days ago to make known to your Majeſty that the Lords of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> deſired that I would by a Memorial to the States general, make known thoſe good Sentiments which your Majeſty hath taken up for the reſt and quiet of that repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, in caſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould let paſs without effect, the prefixed time of the Month of <hi>Jan.</hi> but that I had refuſed to preſent ſuch a Memorial. In the mean time, Sir, the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> are not able by their Authority to bring the States General to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Affairs; to do which it will be neceſſary that Penſionary <hi>Fagel</hi> and the Deputies of the States General do conſent before they look upon themſelves obliged by the preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Memorial. But as it was 205, 33 for to Anſwer the deſigns of the Lords of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> that the States General ſhould enter into a deliberation of what meaſures they ſhould take: in caſe an accommodation ſhould not be concluded betwixt your Majeſty and <hi>Spain</hi> before the end of this Month.</p>
                  <p>We have ſought after all expedients that might ſupply the defects of a Memorial, and they laid before me that I ſhould yield; that the Deputies of the States General ſhould ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ge in a conference with me: In the which a Friend of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> one of the <hi>Holland</hi> Deputies ſhould demand of me my Thoughts concerning what ſhould happen, in caſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould not accept ſome of your Majeſties propoſitions before the end of <hi>Jan.</hi> from whence he might find matter enough for the deliberation of the States General to me. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> went immediately to deſire two of the Deputies of the States General, that were moſt inclined to the intereſt of the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> that they would accept of a Deputation, and it was to be demanded from me. To give an expreſs Anſwer to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints relating to the Ship called the <hi>Reagle;</hi> theſe were preſently ready and glad that they ſaw the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> willing to make Complaints againſt <hi>France,</hi> but others ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further then they ſaw, that the deſign of the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was nothing elſe but to get a Conference with me. This being their ſuſpicion, was the cauſe that this expedient took no effect; but the neceſſity in which the States General found themſelves to return me a Complement, upon my giving them notice of the birth of the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> did give us an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of another expedient, which by the vigilance of the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was not eſs ſerviceable to us than the former.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43438:2"/>
                  <p>For upon ſuch Occaſion, there being no more than three Deputies appointed, it fell out luckily (all places having their turns) to fall upon the Deputies of <hi>Holland, Freeſland,</hi> and <hi>Groningham;</hi> to come to me; ſo that the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> having throughly informed the Lords of <hi>Friſland</hi> and <hi>Groningham,</hi> and deſired the aforeſaid two Lords to diſcourſe with me in the ſame manner, that the Deputies of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſhould have diſcourſed with me, in caſe the Deputation of the States General had been compleated, the three aforeſaid Deputies came yeſterday to me, and gave me to underſtand how much the States General rejoyced in the happy Birth of the D of <hi>Anjou.</hi> After which the Deputies of <hi>Freeſland</hi> and <hi>Groningham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Diſcourſe of thoſe Diſturbances which might ariſe, in caſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould paſs by the Month of <hi>Jan.</hi> without effect: The Deputy of <hi>Holland,</hi> that had the Precedency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the Diſcourſe that happened between us was of importance enough to be reported to the States General; and in regard he could not do it except I gave it him in Writing, he therefore deſired that I would put it into the form of a Memorial: I anſwered him that he was in the right, if I had any thing to propoſe, or was to requeſt any thing in the behalf of your Majeſty, but that this was only as an Anſwer to what was ſaid to me by thoſe Lords that were in the ſame Deputation, and that it was not a requeſt of your Majeſties, and that it was ſufficient for them that they knew it might be granted them, when the States General ſhould think it matter of Advantage to them; and therefore I left it to them to examine what was moſt for their Conveniency, and that I would give them further Satisfaction, in caſe they deſired a larger Information of your Majeſties Sentiments; after which the ſaid Deputies took their leaves, and about an hour after that, the Deputies of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> came to Viſit me, and to inform me of their Endeavours, and that no matters came into debate before the States General but what came by way of Memorial; but that notwithſtanding, when a Miniſter had diſcourſed with the Deputies of the States General, that the Deputies did agree amongſt themſelves whether the matter then Diſcourſed off ought to be a matter of deliberation or not, and that the Deputies of <hi>Frieſland</hi> and <hi>Groningham</hi> had given their words that they did agree, that all the Diſcourſe that happened in the laſt Conference ought to be taken into deliberation. But</p>
                  <p>Sir, notwithſtanding all theſe precautions, the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> dare not be confident that the States General will take this Affair into deliberation; for the Authority of the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> and the direction of Penſianary <hi>Fagel</hi> is very great; which appears plain enough, for that the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> could not prevail ſo far with the States General, as to take into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation the Memorials of the 5th of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and the 29 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> laſt, which I preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; they alſo declared to me that they could wiſh that I would preſent a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, though it were only to make publick the good Inclinations of your Majeſty to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; alledging that the knowledge of what has been already done, has had ſo conſiderable effects, that it is to be hoped they will have more when it comes to be ſpread abroad. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inſinuated to me that a Memorial might be ſo formed, as that the Propoſals might ſeem no otherwiſe intended but to the advantage of the States General: As for Example,</p>
                  <p>That I having obſerved from ſeveral Diſcourſes from the Members of this Government, the apprehenſions they have of the Arms of your Majeſty, in caſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould not come to an accommodation before the end of <hi>Jan.</hi> of which having the honour to give an account to your Majeſty, and that your Majeſty had given me order to declare to the States General that in caſe they remained as they were, and that they would ſend order to thoſe Troops that were ſent to aſſiſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not to Act otherwiſe then for the defence of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons, that then your Majeſty, for the quieting of the Apprehenſions of the States General, will promiſe and aſſure them to deſiſt from further Attacks, and turn your Arms elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and that he would be contented only with quartering of Troops and raiſing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the Aſſurance which your Majeſty expects from them, that they will not begin any new Levy; that is an Affair that muſt be diſcourſed by word of Mouth and not by Memorial; for that would look like meddling with their Government: but it will be enough to lay before them, that they continue in the condition in which they are, and ſuch other Matters as may be convenient, and then they will ſooner think of the Caſhiering of Troops, than raiſing more. The Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> have extreamly preſſed me to obtain this permiſſion from your Majeſty, aſſuring me, that they will not be wanting, that it ſhall obtain its end: They have alſo aſſured me there is hardly a day paſſes, but they gain ſome of the Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> to their Sentiments, and that they have juſt now obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the like from one of the Principal, and that they are uſing all endeavours to bring the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43438:2"/>
                     <hi>Spaniards</hi> to an Accomodation, which if they cannot obtain, that then ſuch methods ſhould be uſed as was propoſed for the Peace and Security of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that the Provinces of <hi>Friezland</hi> and <hi>Groningham</hi> will come over to their Sentiments, and therefore deſired me to diſcourſe with ſome of their Deputies, that they may continue ſtedfaſt.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I can aſſure your Majeſty, That the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> have been wanting in nothing on their part and that they are not wanting in their endeavours with other Cities: But, Sir, I muſt not forget to ſay before your Majeſty, That ſome of the Members of this <hi>State</hi> have made difficulty to allow your Majeſty to come with Militiary Execution upon the open Countrey of the <hi>Spainiſh Netherlands,</hi> for that being done, it will be impoſſible for thoſe Provinces to maintain themſelves, they being deprived of ſubſiſtance; and that it will tend immediately to the taking away of the <hi>Barriere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In caſe the ways through <hi>Flanders</hi> had been ſecure, I ſhould not have taken the freedom to have ſent this Pacquet by a Courier; but becauſe I could not have written till Tueſday by the way of <hi>Liege,</hi> I thought it a matter of greater importance then to defer it till that day, from giving your Majeſty Account of Affairs in this Countrey; for that it appears to me to be a Matter of ſo great a Concern, that your Majeſty be exactly informed thereof.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the Diſpoſitions which I perceive in the Minds of People do not ſuddenly change, this Affair in a few days will come to a great extremity. Your Majeſty well knows that in the beginning the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> endeavoured to win thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to conſent to the Levies, but not obtaining his end, he would reſolve it in the Aſſembly of the <hi>States of Holland;</hi> notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> there was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning but one <hi>City</hi> that declared they could not conſent, <hi>that a Matter</hi> of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould be brought to a <hi>Reſolution</hi> without a general conſent: The <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> flatter'd himſelf that he could bring <hi>that City</hi> to agree with the reſt, and ſo have concluded <hi>that Matter.</hi> But the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> being animated by the goodneſs of your Majeſty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared towards them, and being ſtrengthened by thoſe Methods laid before them, were not <hi>contented</hi> only to refuſe their Levies, but inveyed ſeverely againſt them, and have made ſo great an Intereſt in many of the <hi>Cities,</hi> that ſeveral of them are come over to their <hi>Sentiments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus your Majeſty may ſee how this <hi>Matter</hi> continued for ſome time; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> not being able to bear the Affront any longer, after four days entred upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Reſolution, for conſidering that there were more <hi>Cities</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> that gave their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for the Levies, notwithſtanding the opoſition of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> then thoſe againſt it, he took a Reſolution, to cauſe all the <hi>Cities</hi> to give their Voices; and though there might be ſix or ſeven that might agree with <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in the ſame <hi>Sentiment,</hi> yet he intended to conclude the Levies by pluralities of Voices.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis believed his principal Deſign was to ſave his Reputation abroad, by cauſing the ſaid Levies to be reſolved on, againſt the conſent of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> it being well known in this Countrey, that Penſionary <hi>Fagell</hi> can come to what Concluſion he pleaſes, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Conſtitution of the Republick, when aſſiſted by the power of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange;</hi> and it is as well known that he can have no great advantage by this Reſolution, for that no man will venture to lend money to the Solicitors for the advancing of theſe Levies. And this is the Sentiment of the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> which he declared to the <hi>Heer van Harem;</hi> whom he alſo told, that he would come to this Reſolution the next Week: but though this Reſolution may be of little profit to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> yet in other reſpects it may be of great advantage to him, either by reaſon of thoſe great Diviſions that will be made in the <hi>State,</hi> or by pleaſing the Marquis <hi>De Grana,</hi> thereby to make <hi>Spain</hi> believe <hi>that the Hollanders</hi> will ſend great Supplies to them, and that the <hi>Amſterdamers</hi> uſe endeavours to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, As for me, I hope that for the ſame reaſon that makes me fear the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> will not be able to obtain any thing againſt the will of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> that <hi>the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> will not have cauſe to complain of your Majeſty concerning the Aſſurance deſired of them, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhould not be able to gain his end in raiſing the Levies againſt the will of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and in caſe he purſues his Reſolution, it will ſoon appear that it will be to little purpoſe, for <hi>that it</hi> will be eaſier both for one and the other ſide to traverſe each other in their <hi>Sentiments,</hi> then to cauſe them to take effect.</p>
                  <p>I muſt ſay this further to your Majeſty, That <hi>Monſieur Paes,</hi> and others of the ſame <hi>Sentiment</hi> have re-aſſumed Courage; and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> have had Reſolution enough; and for certain, in caſe the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhall <hi>attempt</hi> any thing by violence, he will meet with more oppoſitions than he im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sir, This is that which obliges me to repreſent to your Majeſty, That I cannot ſo eaſily and ſpeedily as formerly, have the honour of your Majeſties Orders, relating to Affairs that may accidentally happen; and in caſe your Majeſty ſhall think good to give me any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders tending to your ſervice, with permiſſion to execute the ſame as occaſion requires, they may be of great uſe for the ſupporting of thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to enter upon ſuch Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents as they ſhall propoſe me, that ſo your Majeſty might not be at a loſs to preſent a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial in caſe of neceſſity; but if not, yet to deſire a Conference with the <hi>States General,</hi> who will immediately ſend their Deputies to diſcourſe with me in this Affair: and in purſuance of this Conference, I would deliver over in writing what has been diſcourſed betwixt us, which would be a means to palliate the matter; for the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> are not a little alarmed at the pretended coming over of a 136, and do ſay that it is nothing elſe but to amuſe them, that I am ſo earneſt to make theſe propoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty that you will be pleas'd to let me know if there be any Affairs wherein I might launch out my ſelf to the uttermoſt, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obſtruction to what your Majeſty demands, relating to the ruin of the open Countrey of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in which I find ſo many difficulties, if the matter ſhould come ſo far, which I yet queſtion: I do not give my ſelf the honour to ask of your Majeſty what I muſt do as to the aſſurance that may be deſired of the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in caſe they cannot bring the States General to grant unto your Majeſty what has been laid before me; (as yet I know not what the intent of your Majeſty is) I can only ſay that the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> have not as yet explained that matter, and have told me expreſly that theſe are remedies they muſt only have recourſe unto, in caſe of the uttermoſt extremity; neither will they ſay any thing to me of that Affair, before they have loſt all hopes of obtaining from the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral thoſe aſſurances of giving your Majeſty ſatisfaction; which they do yet flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they ſhall obtain.</p>
